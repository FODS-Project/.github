## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**
-->
🙋‍♀️ This Organization contained two project repositories of Course Project "File Organisation and Database System"\
      - One for Client-side interface\
      - another one for the Server-side queries\
      The project is based on an ERP Database system using MySQL, NodeJs, and ReactJs\
      while implementing the optimal Entity Relationship among attributes of Data-sets.\
🌈 Project has been done under Prof. Adrijit Goswami Department of Mathematics, IIT Kharagpur
#### Implemented User Interface at client-side
User can :\
Register as Student or Institute employee\
User can alter their details\
Admins can access student's details\
User can access their daily schedule\
And Student can get their Subject Registration/grading details
#### Implemented ER diagram at server-side
Entities: Student, Course, Faculty\
Attributes: Student (ID, Name, Age), Course (CourseID, Title, Credits), Faculty (ID, Name, Department)\
Relationships: Enroll (between Student and Course), Teach (between Faculty and Course).\
In the ER diagram, we would have rectangles representing Student, Course, and Faculty entities.\
The attributes of each entity will be represented inside the corresponding rectangles.\
For example, the "Student" entity will have attributes ID, Name, and Age.\
The primary keys (unique identifiers) will be underlined.
